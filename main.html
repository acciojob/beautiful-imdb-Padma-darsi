	<p class="movieDetail">It's about honesty and struggle for good being, fused with a love story. The director strongly depicted the positive attitude of Manoj in his struggle. Had Manoj failed the exam still he would have made his family proud in one way or the other. And that's due to his positive behavior.</p>
